You have been assigned an issue 🥂 and are confused 😵 about where to go from here, follow this guide below to make your changes and pull request 🍾.

## Getting Started
Fork the Cookie repository. See below 👇

![fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76417084/193394675-6a74ff28-68d9-44c0-bc13-d64e9ca72ffe.png)

Using the command below, you can clone the repo.
```

```

Navigate to the cloned directory using command line. See below 👇

```
cd cookie
```

Make a new branch.
```
git checkout -b "Your Branch Name"
